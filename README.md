Repository to share and collaborate on our projects!

## Getting Started

To setup your environment you can run
`conda env update --file environment.yml`
given you have a conda installation.

After you have installed _nbdev_ you should run `nbdev_install_git_hooks`. If you happen to have merge conflicts try `nbdev_fix_merge filename.ipynb`. More information about `nbdev` can be found on the [nbdev github](https://github.com/fastai/nbdev).
